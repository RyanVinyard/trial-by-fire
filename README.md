# _ViaVitae (Working Title)_

#### _A prototype criminal activity aggregator for downtown Eugene, April 2017_

#### By _**Fran Velazquez, Ryan Vinyard, and Yuchin Pan**_

## Description

_This is our prototype app for reporting non emergency criminal or suspicious activity seen in downtown Eugene. It will allow its users to register for the app, then use the app to report suspicious behavior they have seen downtown. Incidents come with varying levels of severity, and ideally only a certain amount of tips could be submitted over an amount of time. Via Vitae means Street Life in Latin, and as the name implies, we want our users to feel secure on the streets they will spend so much time on. It also sends a message to those who would threaten, harrass, or otherwise, that they will not be tolerated in our collective Via Vitae!_
